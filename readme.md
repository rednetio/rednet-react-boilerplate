# rednet-react-boilerplate

This is a boilerplate package to get quickly up and going on our stack.

It is merely a WIP at this point. Don't use it.

# Commands

  * `npm run build`: runs Babel against server-code and Webpack against client-code in a PRODUCTION environment.
  * `npm run hot`: runs the server and webpack with hot-loading.
  * `npm start`: runs the (compiled) server code. Has to be run after `npm run build` and wonâ€™t serve assets.
  * `npm test`: runs Mocha.
  * `npm run lint`: runs Eslint.
